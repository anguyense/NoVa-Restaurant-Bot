# NoVa Restaurant Bot
 Inspired by https://twitter.com/_restaurant_bot, which is on an international scale.

 This Twitter bot posts about random restaurants in Northern Virginia daily. These posts contain the name, address, star rating, Google maps link, and four pictures. 

 Note: At the time of creating this bot, the 'node-fetch' package from v3 is an ESM-only module, so it is unable to be imported with require(). If you want to continue using this package while using require() for your other packages, you will want to 'npm install node-fetch@2'.
